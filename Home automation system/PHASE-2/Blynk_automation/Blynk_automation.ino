  Download latest Blynk library here:
    https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/releases/latest

  Blynk is a platform with iOS and Android apps to control
  Arduino, Raspberry Pi and the likes over the Internet.
  You can easily build graphic interfaces for all your
  projects by simply dragging and dropping widgets.

  This example code is in public domain.

 *************************************************************
  Note: This only works on Android!
        iOS does not support Bluetooth 2.0 Serial Port Profile
        You may need to pair the module with your smartphone
        via Bluetooth settings. Default pairing password is 1234

  Feel free to apply it to any other example. It's simple!

  NOTE: Bluetooth support is in beta!

  Youâ€™ll need:
   - Blynk App (download from AppStore or Google Play)
   - Arduino Uno board
   - Decide how to connect to Blynk
     (USB, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ...)

  There is a bunch of great example sketches included to show you how to get
  started. Think of them as LEGO bricks  and combine them as you wish.
  For example, take the Ethernet Shield sketch and combine it with the
  Servo example, or choose a USB sketch and add a code from SendData
  example.
